Islamic Finance Overview

Islamic finance operates according to Shariah law. The key principle is the prohibition of riba (interest). Instead, Islamic finance uses profit-sharing and risk-sharing mechanisms.

Main instruments include Murabaha (cost-plus financing), Mudarabah (profit-sharing), and Musharakah (joint venture). These ensure ethical and fair financial transactions.
