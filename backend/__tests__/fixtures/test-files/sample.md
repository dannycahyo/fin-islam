# Islamic Finance: Principles and Practices

## Introduction to Islamic Finance

Islamic finance is a financial system that operates according to Islamic law (Shariah). The fundamental principle of Islamic finance is the prohibition of riba (interest or usury).

## Core Principles

### 1. Prohibition of Riba (Interest)

The charging or paying of interest is strictly forbidden in Islamic finance. Instead, Islamic financial institutions operate on the principle of **profit and loss sharing**.

### 2. Risk Sharing

Islamic finance promotes risk-sharing between the provider of capital and the user of funds.

### 3. Prohibition of Gharar

Transactions must be free from excessive uncertainty or ambiguity.

### 4. Ethical Investment

Islamic finance prohibits investment in businesses that are considered haram (forbidden), such as those dealing with:

- Alcohol
- Gambling
- Pork products
- Weapons

## Islamic Financial Instruments
