# Islamic Banking vs Conventional Banking - Comprehensive Comparison

# Overview

While Islamic banking and conventional banking both provide financial services, they operate under fundamentally different principles, structures, and objectives. Islamic banking is grounded in Shariah (Islamic law), which prohibits interest (riba), excessive uncertainty (gharar), and gambling (maysir), while promoting risk-sharing, ethical investments, and social justice. This comparison explores the key differences and similarities between these two banking systems.

# Fundamental Principles

## Islamic Banking Principles

**Prohibition of Riba (Interest)**

Money cannot generate money by itself. Earning returns requires:

- Actual trade in goods or services
- Risk-bearing and entrepreneurship
- Productive economic activity
- Asset-backed transactions

**Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty)**

Transactions must be:

- Clear and transparent
- Free from ambiguity
- Well-defined in terms and conditions
- Based on disclosed information

**Prohibition of Maysir (Gambling/Speculation)**

Wealth must be earned through:

- Legitimate business activities
- Not games of chance
- Not pure speculation
- Real economic contribution

**Asset-Backed Financing**

All financing must be backed by:

- Tangible assets
- Real services
- Actual business activities
- Not mere money lending

**Risk-Sharing**

Profit and loss should be shared:

- Between financier and entrepreneur
- Based on agreed ratios
- Proportional to contribution and risk
- Equitable distribution

**Ethical Investments**

Investments must avoid:

- Alcohol production

- Gambling operations
- Adult entertainment

**Social Justice**

Banking should promote:

- Equitable wealth distribution

- Support for the disadvantaged
- Community development

## Conventional Banking Principles

**Profit Maximization**

Primary objective is:

- Maximizing shareholder returns
- Increasing profitability
- Market share growth
- Stock price appreciation

**Time Value of Money**

Money has inherent time value:

- Interest compensates for time
- Present value calculations
- Discounted cash flows
- Risk-free rate as baseline

**Risk Transfer**

Risk is transferred:

- From borrower to lender (via collateral)
- From clients to bank (via insurance)
- Through derivatives and hedging
- Fixed returns regardless of outcomes

**Market-Based Approach**

Driven by:

- Supply and demand
- Market interest rates
- Competitive forces
- Regulatory compliance

**Unrestricted Investment**

Can invest in:

- Any legal business
- Any financial instrument
- Any market sector
- No religious restrictions

# Operational Structure

## Deposit Accounts

### Islamic Banking

**Current Accounts (Qard-based)**

- Based on interest-free loan (qard) from customer to bank
- Bank guarantees principal
- No return to depositor
- Bank can use funds and keeps all profits
- Customer pays fees for services

**Savings/Investment Accounts (Mudaraba-based)**

- Based on profit-sharing (mudaraba)
- Depositors are capital providers (rabb al-mal)
- Bank is manager/entrepreneur (mudarib)
- Profits shared per agreed ratio (e.g., 70:30)
- Depositors bear risk of losses (though often minimized through reserves)
- Returns variable based on bank's investment performance
- No guaranteed return

**Investment Accounts (Wakala-based)**

- Based on agency (wakala)
- Bank acts as agent for depositors
- Fixed fee or performance-based fee
- Returns depend on investment performance
- More transparent fee structure

### Conventional Banking

**Current/Checking Accounts**

- Simple deposit relationship
- Bank guarantees principal
- Usually no interest or very low interest
- Service fees may apply
- Bank can use funds freely

**Savings Accounts**

- Guaranteed principal
- Predetermined interest rate
- Fixed or variable rate
- Interest credited periodically
- FDIC insured (in US) or equivalent protection
- No investment risk to depositor

**Time Deposits/CDs**

- Fixed term
- Guaranteed interest rate
- Penalty for early withdrawal
- Principal fully protected
- Predictable returns

## Financing/Lending

### Islamic Banking

**Sale-Based Financing (Murabaha)**

- Bank purchases asset
- Sells to client at cost plus markup
- Asset-backed transaction
- Profit disclosed transparently
- Fixed payment schedule
- No compounding for late payments

Example: Home financing

- Bank buys house: $100,000
- Sells to client: $150,000
- Client pays in installments over 15 years
- Total known upfront

**Leasing (Ijara)**

- Bank owns asset
- Client rents it
- Rental payments for use
- Ownership may transfer at end (ijara wa iqtina)
- Bank responsible for major repairs

**Partnership (Musharaka/Mudaraba)**

- Profit and loss sharing
- Equity-based financing
- Variable returns
- True risk-sharing
- Used less frequently than murabaha

### Conventional Banking

**Loans**

- Money lent to borrower
- Interest charged on principal
- Fixed or variable rate
- Compound interest on defaults
- Principal plus interest repaid
- Not necessarily asset-backed

Example: Home mortgage

- Bank lends: $100,000
- Interest: 5% per year for 15 years
- Total repayment: ~$142,000
- Interest amount not known upfront if variable rate

**Lines of Credit**

## Example: $100,000 Home Financing for 15 Years

**Islamic (Murabaha)**

- Bank buys house: $100,000
- Sells to client for: $150,000 (total)
- Monthly payment: $833.33 ($150,000 / 180 months)
- Total cost: $150,000 (fixed)
- Effective rate: ~5.5% (roughly)

**Conventional (Mortgage)**
